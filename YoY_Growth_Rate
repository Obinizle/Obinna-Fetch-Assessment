// At what percent has Fetch grown year over year? 
Assumption: The transcation data only exist for 2024 and as such I calculated user growth year on year instead since the data span accross multiple years. //

WITH UserYearlyCount AS (
	SELECT 
		YEAR(CREATED_DATE) AS year,
			COUNT(ID) AS user_count
	FROM USERS
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY YEAR DESC
)
UserGrowthRate AS 
	(
	SELECT 
		year,
		user_count,
		LAG(user_count) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS previous_year_count
		(user_count - LAG(user_count) OVER (ORDER BY year))/ LAG(user_count) OVER (ORDER BY year) * 100 AS YoY_Growth
	FROM UserYearlyCount
)
SELECT * FROM UserGrowthRate WHERE previous_year_count IS NOT NULL;
