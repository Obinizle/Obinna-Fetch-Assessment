// At what percent has Fetch grown year over year? 
Assumption: The transcation data only exist for 2024 and as such I calculated user growth year on year instead since the data span accross multiple years. //

WITH YearlyUserCount AS (
	SELECT 
		YEAR(CREATED_DATE) AS year,
			COUNT(USER_ID) AS user_count
	FROM USER
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY YEAR DESC
)
SELECT
	year,
	user_count,
	(user_count - LAG(user_count) OVER (ORDER BY year))/ LAG(user_count) OVER (ORDER BY year) * 100 AS YoY_Growth
